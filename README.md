# QuAntiL Documentation

The documentation can be found at: https://quantil.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

## Setup for Changes
For setting up the documentation, first, install the requirements in the ``requirements.txt`` assuming Python is already installed.  
The Python versions 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, and pypy3 are supported, see the [MkDocs website](https://www.mkdocs.org/#installation).

Then, build the documentation with:
```
$ mkdocs serve
``` 

Changes can be seen directly under http://127.0.0.1:8000.
