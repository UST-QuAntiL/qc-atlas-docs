## Create Algorithm

To create an algorithm the user has to navigate to the ``Algorithm List View`` by using the navigation sidebar.
This view displays a list of all available algorithms. Creating a new algorithm is done via the ``Plus Button`` which is located above the list.

Clicking on the ``Plus Button`` will open the following dialog.

In the dialog it is possible to give the new algotihm a name.

Besides the name it is also necessary to assign a type to the new algorithm. 
There are three types to choose from: ``Classic``, ``Quantum`` and ``Hybrid``.

If a quantum algorithm has been selected, a suitable quantum computation model must also be selected.
Again there are three types to choose from: ``Gate Based``,  ``Measurement Based`` and``Quantum Annealing``.

After all necessary fields have been filled in, the creation of the algorithm can be confirmed by clicking on the ``OK Button``. After a successfull creation, the user will be navigated to the detailed view of the new algorithm.

## Delete Algorithm

To delete an algorithm the user has to navigate to the ``Algorithm List View`` list view by using the navigation sidebar.

To delete single algorithms, the user can just press the ``Delete Button`` in the actions column of the table.

It is also possible to delete mulitple algorithms at once by selecting them one by one using the checkboxes within the table. When at least one algorithm is selected, a ``Mater Delete Button`` will show up above the table. To delete the selected algorithms at once, this button must be pressed.

Both ways of deleting algorithm will lead to a confirmation dialog. This dialog will list all the previously selected algorthims that will be deleted. To finally confirm the deletion, the ``OK Button`` at the bottom of the dialog has to be pressed. After a successfull deletion the deleted algorithms will disappear from the table.
