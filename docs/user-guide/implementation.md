## Create Implementation

!!! info 
    To create a new implementation, the user has to be in the ``Implementations Tab`` of the ``Algorithm View``, which can be reached by clicking on an algorithm in the ``Algorithm List View``.

Creating a new implementation is done by clicking on the ``Plus Button`` located above the data table.

This will open the following ``Creation Dialog``, where the user has to type in all required information for creating a new implementation.

!!! note 
    Currently, only the ``name`` is required to create a new implementation.

After entering all required information, the user has to confirm the creation of the implementation by clicking on the ``OK Button``.

If the creation of the implementation was successful, the user will be redirected to the detailed ``Implementation view`` of the new implementation.

## Delete Implementation

!!! info 
    To delete a implementation, the user has to be in the ``Implementations Tab`` of the ``Algorithm View``, which can be reached by clicking on an algorithm in the ``Algorithm List View``.

To remove a specific implementation, the user has to simply click on the ``Delete Button`` in the ``Actions Column`` of the data table.

The user can also remove multiple implementations at once by selecting them using the check-boxes of the data table. After the user has made his selection he can press the ``Master Delete Button`` at the top of the data table.

!!! note 
    The delete button will only appear after at least one implementations has been selected by the user.

To confirm the deletion of the selected implementation(s), the user has to click on the ``YES Button`` of the ``Confirmation Dialog``.

!!! note 
    **Names** of implementations that will be deleted are displayed in the body of the dialog and should be checked before confirming the deletion.
