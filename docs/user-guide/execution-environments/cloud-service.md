## Create Cloud Service

To create a cloud service the user has to navigate to the ``Cloud Services List View`` by using the navigation sidebar. 
This will be done by first clicking on the ``Execution Environments`` menu in the navigation sidebar, which makes the ``Cloud Services`` submenu visible.
In general, the ``Cloud Service List View`` displays a list of all available cloud services. Creating a new cloud service is done via the ``Plus Button`` which is located above the list.
